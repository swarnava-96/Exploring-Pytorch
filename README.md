# Exploring-Pytorch

## Installation Setup:
##### 1. First create a virtual environment by using this command:

### Getting started with Pytorch:
Topics covered:
```
1. Converting Numpy arrays into Pytorch tensors
2. Arithmatic Operations
```
What are tensors?

A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices and is easily understood as a multidimensional array.It is a term and set of techniques known in machine learning in the training and operation of deep learning models can be described in terms of tensors. In many cases tensors are used as a replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.

Tensors are a type of data structure used in linear algebra, and like vectors and matrices, you can calculate arithmetic operations with tensors.
